[[ Dependency ]]

To be able to use Escalier you need to have installed the following
software on your machine:

   - OpenSplice DDS >= v5.x (http://www.opensplice.org)
   - Simple Build Tool (SBT) (http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/)


[[ Setup ]]

Make sure that SBT and OpenSplice DDS are properly installed and
configured. At this point you should do the following, from the
Escalier home directory:
$ ./configure
$ sbt update
$ sbt compile
$ sbt package
$ sbt doc

At this point you'll have the built and packaged Escalier and you will
also have generated the documentation. At this point you are ready to
run some of the examples you write your own application.
